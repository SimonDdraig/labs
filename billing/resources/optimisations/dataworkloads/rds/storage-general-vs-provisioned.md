    - â˜… General Tip:   
    - Make sure you consider pricing of io2 if you have chosen it without requiring higher IOPS, for example:  
      - 400 GiB of Storage  
        - General Purpose SSD (gp3) \- 12,000 IOPS  
          - Storage pricing (monthly): $110.40  
          - Cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads running on medium-sized DB instances  
          - Latency of single-digit millisecond, provided consistently 99% of the time  
        - Provisioned IOPS 2 \- 12,000 IOPS  
          - Storage pricing (monthly): $2750.40  
          - Designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads  
          - Latency of sub-millisecond, provided consistently 99.9% of the time  
          - If you are currently using io1, io2 is priced the same but with better performance  
      - Note, make sure the instance class and size can work with the number of IOPS provisioned  
        - Smaller instances are capped at lower IOPS regardless of what you may provision, and you will stay pay for them
